## Why

As I concluded my graduate work in 2014, my life took a sharp detour. It took 4 years of uncertainty from many medical experts to come to a realization that myself and many others had somehow managed to make it this far with a life-long condition that would have explained the atypical struggles were had been encouraged to "mask" in order to get by. Tech is why I was able to excel, why I and others no longer could, and why this gap continues to grow.

There is little realization of the problem, but it is not a "personal problem", and it is not just "my disability". It is a "social blackhole" that grows with the adoption of tech, and a poor understanding of the manifestations of the mainstream-first design mentality that leads to "artificial disability" piling on top of one's "natural disability". That while we shifted the accessbility of tech to encompass the majority, we did that by displacing new "artificial disability" and we are unable to understand that because "no one action is directly responsible for this".

## How

I personally do a few things:

- Use [Quora](https://www.quora.com/search?q=autism&author=956284302) to understand things faced by folks with my condition, separate from what "doctors will tell you" because that was not just enough, it was often misleading.

- Work with [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/) trying to devise metrics that can help addressing accessibility matters within the open source community, projects, contributors and users.

- Help coordinate initiatives and efforts within the [Node.js Community Committee](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee) and the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/).

- Use my knowledge and expertise to try to understand the design considerations that help reduce "friction", ie what it takes to offer a "frictionless" mainstream-oriented experience, a more inclusive user experience, [looking for the CX](https://medium.com/@smotaal/looking-for-the-cx-342e8ccbbb24).

- Try not advocate for one issue, or one demographic, and advocate only for inclusive design.
